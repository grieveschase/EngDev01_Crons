Chase Grieves, May 2020.
The purpose of this script is to copy image containing directories from the CD-SEMs to a location on the shared network drive.
This script is intended to run on a local VM with mounted paths to the SEM image storage directories (source) and the shared network drive (dest).

Highlevel Walkthrough:
Check and create current month directory (dest) to store images based on month of measurement and which tool it was measured on.
Utilize os.listdir() to pull name of all image directories and filter which ones to copy to network based on time range (copy if measured between now and now - time_range).
Send os.system() commands to copy recursively and retain time stamp.

Application Logging takes place for successful events: app_log.txt
Error logging takes place for error events: error_log.txt
